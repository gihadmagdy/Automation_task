# Automation_task

Here how to run the script 
We got 2 ways:
The first one is :

open the project and go to "feature" file with path (C:\Users\NasrG\Desktop\Task1\src\test\resources\features\login.feature).

but no report will be created through this run 


The secound one is 

open project and open TestRunnerfile with path (C:\Users\NasrG\Desktop\Task1\src\test\java\StepDefinitions\testrunner)

Run this file 

And test report will be created with path(C:\Users\NasrG\Desktop\Task1\target\htmlReports)
